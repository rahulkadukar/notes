| Arun Note 8 | 930 | 465 | 210 | 255 |
| Thulasi S8 | 750 | 375 | 30 | 345 |

As for the bill we are paid the following amounts, for two months we paid $90 (**$45/month**)
as we were maintaning the extra line. For the rest of the months we are paying **$33.33/month**

| Start | End | Paid |
|:-|:-|-:|
| Sep-17 | Nov-17 | 45 * 2 = 90 |
| Nov-17 | Aug-18 | 33.33 * 9 = 300 |

The total above is $390.

* Arun ($255 + $390) = **$645**
* Thulasi ($345 + $390 - $125) = **$610**
