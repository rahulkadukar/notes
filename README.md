#Notes
These are just notes that I took and if you like them feel free to 
use them. The first thing that I recommend is that you configure 
vi (a real text editor). I use the following settings for my vi

####Enable line numbers and Syntax highlighting
Line numbers and syntax highlighting can be enabled by editing the
.vimrc file and adding the following lines

```bash
  syntax on
  set number
```

####TO DO ADD THEMES/AUTO COMPLETE
This will be done today
