# Notes
These are just notes that I took and if you like them feel free to 
use them. The first thing that I recommend is that you configure 
vi (a real text editor). I use the following settings for my vi as 
found in the config folder in this repository. These settings also
need the color theme Lucius (although this is a personal preference)
and you should change it to whatever you prefer

## Format
The notes contain a lot of mathematical formulae and hence I have
decided to use latex instead of markdown for writing the notes. There
is a tex file in the repository called notes.tex and this can be used
to produce a file in any format using something like **pandoc**
